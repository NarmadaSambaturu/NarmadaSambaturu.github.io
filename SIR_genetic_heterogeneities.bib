    abstract = {Author summary Levels of immunity to strains of H1N1 influenza can vary, depending on the individual. This strongly influences how the disease spreads in a population. Accounting for such variations is a major challenge for the epidemiology of infectious diseases. We study the effect of population-level genetic heterogeneity on the epidemic spread of different strains of H1N1 influenza. We model the immune response of specific ethnicities to a number of H1N1 viral strains, using this information to study disease spread for these (ethnicity, viral strain) epidemic pairs. Our results show that larger genetic diversity at the level of immune response, leading to the presence of susceptibility sub-populations with a broad distribution of susceptibilities, protects against the spread of influenza in a population. We also show that populations with a small number of highly susceptible individuals, but with a large number of less susceptible ones, should exhibit smaller outbreaks than populations with the same average susceptibility but where it is more uniformly distributed. Our work captures some qualitative trends of influenza spread worldwide, providing a first attempt at understanding how susceptibility heterogeneities arising from variations in immune response determine disease spread in populations.},
